As we stroll through this digital garden, here's what's blossoming:

### 🐛 Major Bugs (Pesky Caterpillars in Our Garden)


1. **The Wayward Wallet Import**: Our import wallet feature has lost its way, like a ronin without a master. The private key validation is undergoing rigorous training to restore honor and discipline to the process.

2. **The Stubborn Select Tags**: The select tags in the send modal have become as immovable as ancient stone lanterns, refusing to bend to the user's will. They're hardcoded for now, but soon they'll be back to taking orders like a well-trained samurai.

3. **The Eternal Transaction Twilight**: The transaction tab seems to be trapped in the twilight hours, not showing the latest transactions. We're sending it on a journey through time to remind it that dawn always follows dusk.

4. **The Dancing Spirits of Notification and Toast**: Our notifications and toasts have been possessed by playful spirits, drifting and dancing across the screen like they’re at a matsuri. We're performing a digital purification ritual to guide them back to their proper places.

5. **The Wandering Public Key Samurai**: When displaying keys, the public key has taken on the role of a wandering samurai, appearing as the latest one for all. We're working to ensure it stays loyal to its rightful daimyo.

6. **The Stuck Account Switcher**: The account switcher is currently frozen like a Zen monk in deep meditation, unresponsive to change. We're helping it break free from its trance to once again follow the user's commands.



7. **The Kanji Conundrum**: Sometimes, when switching from Japanese to English, the app starts speaking in haiku. While poetic, it's not very practical. We're working on teaching it proper grammar.

8. **The Overeager Notification Yokai**: Our notification system sometimes gets a bit too excited and sends multiple notifications for a single event. We're currently performing an exorcism (aka debugging) to calm it down.



### 🛠️ Active Fixes (Our Busy Gardeners)

1. **Operation Smooth Scroll**: We're optimizing the UI to be smoother than a zen garden's sand. Expected to roll out faster than you can say "Nani?!"

2. **The Great Wallet Connect**: Improving connection stability with hardware wallets. No more "top 10 anime betrayals" when your wallet disconnects mid-transaction.

3. **Sakura Speed Boost**: Implementing Layer 2 solutions to make transactions faster and cheaper. We're aiming for speed that would make even ninja envious.

4. **Pikachu Error Page Upgrade**: Our beloved Pikachu 404 page is getting new animations. Soon, it'll be using Thunderbolt on broken links!

5. **The Multilingual Maestro Update**: Enhancing our language switching mechanism to ensure it translates with the grace of a haiku master, not a confused tourist.


6. **The Sidebar Shogun**: A mighty sidebar is being added to our app, providing quick access to all your essentials. Like a skilled samurai, it’ll always be by your side, ready to serve.

7. **The Global Sensei**: We're introducing a Help page that will guide you like a wise sensei, with tips and tricks from around the world. Whether you’re a novice or a master, you’ll find the wisdom you need.

8. **The Notification Ninjutsu**: A dedicated Notification page is on the way, bringing you updates and trends with the stealth and precision of a ninja. You'll never miss a beat as you stay informed on the latest from across the globe.

9. **The Samurai Swap**: Enhancing our swap functionality for seamless transitions between assets. Soon, you'll be swapping faster than a katana's strike, with accuracy to match.

10. **The Koi Fish Revamp**: We're redesigning our dashboard to flow like a koi pond, making navigation as tranquil and intuitive as possible. Expect a serene yet powerful user experience.

11. **The Shogunate's Security**: Fortifying our app's security with password and login authentication, local storage of important credentials, and the persistence of states over login sessions. Your data will be guarded like a treasured scroll in a samurai’s vault, ensuring seamless continuity every time you enter the app.

Let me know if there's anything else you'd like to add!


12. **Gas Fee Guesstimator 3000**: We're fine-tuning our gas fee estimation algorithm. Soon it'll be so accurate, you'll think it's using a crystal ball (spoiler: it's just really good math).


Stay tuned as we continue to nurture our digital garden. Remember, in the world of Sakura Wallet, every bug fixed is a petal added to our ever-blooming cherry blossom of progress! 🌸
